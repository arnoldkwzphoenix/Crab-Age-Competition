Kaggle competition for estimating the age of a crab based on variables such as the gender, length, diameter, height, weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight. 
The project includes a section for EDA (exploratory data analysis), PCA (principal component analysis), ANN-MLP (Artificial Neural Network - Multi-Layer Perception) model and extra concepts such as gridsearch for optimization.

Much thanks to Makoto-san for helping to contribute parts of the project.
